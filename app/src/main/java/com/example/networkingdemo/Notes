- Networking and Android

    - Network calls from Main thread are NOT ALLOWED
    - ALL INTERNET APPS MUST USE THE INTERNET SYSTEM PERMISSION
    - Generally, we use the network to request data from online source or to send data to an
        online source.
        - This act is generally referred to as "Consuming API Calls"
    - In Android we have a few common libraries to achieve network calls.

        - Java Native
            - HttpURLConnection
            - Then open a HttpURLConnection using the URL Object
            - Buffer through the result from connection
            - close connection
            - You must define a threading scheme

            
        - REST vs SOAP

            SOAP
            Simple Object Access Protocol
                - older
                - only returns xmls
                - protocol based
                - SLOWER
                - kSoap was the common lib used for SOAP in Android
            REST
            Representational State Transfer
                - returns many formats
                - faster
                -
        - Third Party Libraries
            - Retrofit
                - Uses a OkHttp3 client
                - Uses interfaces with Call object returns
                - Interfaces are annotated with the proper Http Verb that interface is for
                - Has  built in (from okHttp3) Sync and Async capabilities.
                - Sync function = execute
                - Async function = enqueue
                - Uses a converter factory to convert results to objects
                - Uses a Call Factory adapter to interact with SOME threading schemes more
                    seemlessly.
                    - RxJava
                    - Coroutines
                - Most commonly used when third parties are allowed.


            - OkHttp   ( Current version = 3 , OkHttp3 )
                - Uses interfaces with Call object returns
                - Has  built in (from okHttp3) Sync and Async capabilities.
                - Sync function = execute
                - Async function = enqueue
            - Volley
                - HttpUrlConnection Client
            - SpringBoot (Not used a lot)


        - JSON
            - Must returns nowadays

        - Parse respnses formatted into a JSON into bjects (PROJO or Data class)
            - 2 Methods
                - Java Native Way
                    - JSON Parser
                - Google way
                    - GSON
                        - Google JSON parser


Image Processing
    - 2 Major 3rd Party Libraries used for image processing
        - Glide
            - Caches resized images from web recourses
            - Has more functionality built in
            - Slower on initial load but faster from cache
            - Heavy weight library (uses alot of memory and methods)
        - Picasso
            - Caches the RAW image
            - Less functionality
            - faster on initial load of image but slower on cached
            - Light weight library
